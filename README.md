# Portfolio Reflection - Draw It or Lose It Software Design
## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The Gaming Room was a client that had an existing Android game called "Draw It or Lose It" and wanted to expand it into a web-based application. They needed a distributed, multi-platform gaming application that could support multiple concurrent teams and players while maintaining the core gameplay of progressive image reveals. The main requirements included single game instance management, unique identification systems for games/teams/players, cross-platform web deployment, and scalable architecture to handle multiple simultaneous games.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a really good job with the technical analysis comparing different operating systems and platforms. The detailed evaluation table breaking down Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile considerations for server-side, client-side, and development tools was comprehensive. I also effectively explained the object-oriented design patterns, especially how the singleton pattern would work with the GameService class and why that was important for the client's requirements.
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the UML class diagram and domain model really helped me understand the relationships between different game objects before writing any code. Having to think through the design constraints upfront, like network latency and browser compatibility issues, made me consider problems I wouldn't have thought about otherwise. The systematic approach of analyzing each platform's pros and cons helped me make informed technical decisions rather than just guessing.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?
I'd probably revise the Requirements section since I left it mostly blank with just the placeholder text. A more detailed breakdown of the functional and non-functional requirements would have made the document more complete and given better context for all the technical decisions I made later in the recommendations.
# How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design?
I focused on the client's main goal of expanding from Android-only to multiple platforms while keeping the same core gameplay. The singleton pattern for GameService directly addressed their need for single game instance management, and the web-based approach solved their cross-platform requirements. I interpreted their scalability needs by recommending containerized microservices and load balancing. Understanding that they wanted to maintain game integrity led me to emphasize security features and reliable state management.
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques would you use in the future?
I started by analyzing the existing Android app structure and then worked through each technical constraint systematically. I used comparison tables to evaluate different platform options objectively rather than making assumptions. In the future, I'd want to include more stakeholder input earlier in the process and maybe create some prototypes to test the technical assumptions I made, especially around the network performance and browser compatibility issues.
